# Balloon-Shooting-Game-in-Assembly-language-x86
The game is written in x86 assembly language. The game is a balloon shooting game where the player controls a character to shoot arrows at moving balloons. Here's a breakdown of the key features and functionalities of the game:

* The game starts with a menu screen displaying the game title and instructions for playing.
* The player controls a character using the up and down arrow keys to move vertically on the screen.
* The player shoots arrows using the space bar key. The arrows are fired from the player's position and travel vertically upwards.
* Balloons appear on the screen and move from right to left at different heights.
* The player's objective is to hit the balloons with arrows by aiming correctly.
* If the player successfully hits a balloon with an arrow, they earn points, and the score is displayed on the screen.
* If the player misses a balloon or allows it to pass without hitting, their miss count increases, and it is also displayed on the screen.
* The game continues until the player misses a certain number of balloons, reaching a game over condition.
* When the game is over, a game over screen is displayed, showing the final score and prompting the player to press Enter to start again.
* The player can restart the game by pressing Enter, which clears the screen and resets the game state.
* The game provides basic collision detection between arrows and balloons to determine if a hit occurs.
* Sound effects are played when a balloon is hit to provide audio feedback to the player.

Overall, the game aims to test the player's aiming skills and hand-eye coordination as they try to shoot down as many balloons as possible while avoiding misses. The score serves as a measure of the player's performance, and the game over screen gives them an opportunity to start a new game and improve their score.
